## My process
I commented outt the part i learned with Madison Kayne and did it from scratch 6hrs later.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

i had fun playing around with background-size instead using background-cover as recommended by my madison. Reason being it giving it width and height sticks it to page.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 100% 50%;
    background-color: var(--Pale-blue);
}
```


I used put on height to 80vw and i my code was distorted. i found the problem using inspect on chrome.(check screenshot-1)


### Continued development

my width doesnt span across on wider diveses, the hero image only goes halfway. 

setting Margin. padding and centering divs has been a big issue so far and it is something i want to keep on practicing until i get it right on first try.
